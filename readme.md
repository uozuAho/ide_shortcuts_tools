# IDE shortcuts etc.

Please yell out, there's probably some stuff I'm doing that I don't realised I'm
doing.

Don't modify anything yet - go through navigation and tests.

## navigation
    goto anything: ctrl+t
    goto definition: ctrl+click
    find usages: F11 (custom)
    navigate back/forward: ctrl +/- ??? mine's custom

## tests
    run all tests: no shortcut, alt-enter
    repeat previous run: no shortcut, alt-enter
    run single test
    show fail/pass


## refactoring

Now copy 'initial_state' to a new directory

    fix namespaces: menu. Show what happened, and what's wrong in initial_state
        - resharper does a lot in one go!
            - remove unused imports
    accept resharper suggestions: alt+enter
    format code: no shortcuts, alt+enter
        format block
        format selection
        format doc
    rename: F2 (custom?)
    introduce parameter
    extract method
    extract class

if time, do debugging?
