# IDE shortcuts etc.

Please yell out, there's probably some stuff I'm doing that I don't realised I'm
doing.

## navigation
    goto anything
    goto implementation
    find usages
    navigate back/forward

## tests
    run all tests
    run single test
    show fail/pass

## refactoring
    accept resharper suggestions
    fix namespaces
    remove imports
    format code
        format doc?
    rename
    introduce parameter
    extract method
    extract class

if time, do debugging?
